# IoT Dashboard C++, .Net, React Project (Frontend)

## Project Overview (motor-speed-frontend)

This frontend is the UI for the Motor Dashboard, visualizing real-time motor data from a .NET backend (with C++ engine integration) using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. It demonstrates:

- Real-time charts and notifications
- CSV export, settings, and dark mode

- **Live-Demo:** [https://motor-speed-temperature.netlify.app/](https://motor-speed-temperature.netlify.app/)
- **Backend-Live:** [https://embedded-motor-engine-speed-temperature.onrender.com/](https://embedded-motor-engine-speed-temperature.onrender.com/)

## How It Works: C++ â†’ C# â†’ React

1. **C++ EngineMock:**

   - Simulates a real motor controller, exporting `GetMotorSpeed()` and `GetMotorTemperature()` via a shared library (DLL/SO/DYLIB).
   - In a real project, this could be replaced with a library that reads from CAN, USB, EtherCAT, or other industrial protocols.

2. **.NET Backend:**

   - Uses P/Invoke (`[DllImport]`) to call the C++ functions directly from C#.
   - `EngineService` samples the engine, stores readings in SQLite (via EF Core), and broadcasts new readings to all clients using SignalR.
   - API endpoints allow fetching all readings, sampling new data, and health checks.

3. **React Frontend:**
   - Connects to the backend SignalR hub for real-time updates.
   - Fetches historical data via REST API (using axios).
   - Displays readings in charts, lists, and notifications, with CSV export and settings.

---

## Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui

- **Vite** for fast dev/build.
- **React** for UI, with functional components and hooks.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for styling and accessibility.
- **Recharts** for real-time data visualization.
- **SettingsModal**, **NotificationSidebar**, **AnimatedMotor**, etc., are reusable components.

---

## Real-Time Communication with SignalR

- Frontend uses `@microsoft/signalr` to subscribe to backend updates and update UI in real time.
- Example usage:

  ```tsx
  import * as signalR from "@microsoft/signalr";
  const hub = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("http://localhost:5001/motorHub")
    .withAutomaticReconnect()
    .build();
  hub.on("NewReading", (reading) => {
    /* update state */
  });
  hub.start();
  ```

---

## API Usage & Data Flow

- Uses axios to call backend endpoints:
  - `GET /api/motor` â€” fetch latest readings
  - `GET /api/motor/sample` â€” trigger a new reading
  - `GET /health` â€” health check
- Example:

  ```tsx
  import axios from "axios";
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get("/api/motor").then((res) => setReadings(res.data));
  }, []);
  ```

---

## Components & Features

- **AnimatedMotor:** 3D gear animation reflecting RPM
- **MotorChart:** Real-time chart (Recharts)
- **ReadingList:** Grouped readings by date, color-coded
- **NotificationSidebar:** Highest/lowest temp & RPM
- **SettingsModal:** Dark mode, max readings, etc.
- **CSV Export:**

  ```tsx
  function exportCsv() {
    const csv = readings
      .map((r) => `${r.id},${r.speed},${r.temperature},${r.timestamp}`)
      .join("\n");
    // ...download logic
  }
  ```

---

## Settings, Dark Mode, CSV, Local Date

- **Dark Mode:** Toggle in settings, uses Tailwind dark classes
- **Max Readings to Keep:** Adjustable in settings modal
- **CSV Export:** Exports all readings as CSV
- **Local Date Handling:**

  - All timestamps are UTC from backend, displayed in user's local time using `toLocaleString()`
  - Example:

  ```tsx
  const d = new Date(r.timestamp);
  const time = d.toLocaleTimeString();
  ```

---

## Running the Frontend

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (18+ recommended)
- Docker (optional)

## Local Development

```sh
cd motor-speed-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Docker Usage

- Frontend has its own `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Use `docker-compose.yml` at project root to orchestrate backend, frontend, and Nginx.
- Example frontend Dockerfile:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:20-alpine AS build
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install && npm run build
  EXPOSE 5173
  CMD ["npm", "run", "preview"]
  ```

---

## Testing (React Testing Library)

- Tests are in `src/components/__tests__/`.
- To run all frontend tests:

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

- Example test:

  ```tsx
  import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
  import AnimatedMotor from "../AnimatedMotor";
  test("renders without crashing", () => {
    render(<AnimatedMotor rpm={1200} />);
  });
  ```

---

## Nginx & SSL

- Nginx is used for serving the frontend, handling HTTPS, and reverse proxying to the backend.
- Configured in `docker-compose.yml` at project root.
- Example Nginx config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://frontend:5173;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend:5001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

- Nginx config for HTTPS, static file serving, and reverse proxy to backend/frontend (see root README and `nginx.conf`).
- Self-signed certs for dev in `/etc/nginx/certs/`.
- For production, replace with real certs.
