## How It Works: C++ → C# → React

1. **C++ EngineMock:**

   - Simulates a real motor controller, exporting `GetMotorSpeed()` and `GetMotorTemperature()` via a shared library (DLL/SO/DYLIB).
   - In a real project, this could be replaced with a library that reads from CAN, USB, EtherCAT, or other industrial protocols.
   - **Example:**

     ```cpp
     extern "C" {
         int GetMotorSpeed();
         int GetMotorTemperature();
     }
     ```

2. **.NET Backend:**

   - Uses P/Invoke (`[DllImport]`) to call the C++ functions directly from C#.
   - `EngineService` samples the engine, stores readings in SQLite (via EF Core), and broadcasts new readings to all clients using SignalR.
   - API endpoints allow fetching all readings, sampling new data, and health checks.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     [DllImport(LIB_NAME)]
     public static extern int GetMotorSpeed();
     ```

3. **React Frontend:**
   - Connects to the backend SignalR hub for real-time updates.
   - Fetches historical data via REST API (using axios).
   - Displays readings in charts, lists, and notifications, with CSV export and settings.

## Backend: .NET, C++ DLL, and Real-World Integration

### C++ Mock Engine

- `EngineMock/enhanced_motor_engine.cpp` and `enhanced_motor_engine.hpp` define and export mock functions.
- Compiled as a shared library (`enhanced_motor_engine.dylib`, `.so`, or `.dll`).

### P/Invoke in C

- `EngineService.cs` uses `[DllImport]` to call C++ functions.
- Example:

  ```csharp
  [DllImport(LIB_NAME)]
  public static extern int GetMotorSpeed();
  ```

### Real-World Integration

- Replace `EngineMock` with your real C++/C library for CAN/USB/EtherCAT.
- Use P/Invoke for direct calls, or C++/CLI wrappers for more complex interop.
- For advanced scenarios, use a message queue, gRPC, or a microservice for hardware abstraction.

### Entity Framework Core

- `AppDbContext` manages the `MotorReadings` table.
- Migrations and schema are managed via EF Core CLI.

### SignalR

- `MotorHub` broadcasts new readings to all connected clients in real time.

---

## Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui

- **Vite** for fast dev/build.
- **React** for UI, with functional components and hooks.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for styling and accessibility.
- **Recharts** for real-time data visualization.
- **SettingsModal**, **NotificationSidebar**, **AnimatedMotor**, etc., are reusable components.

---

## Real-Time Communication with SignalR

- Backend pushes new readings instantly to all clients via SignalR.
- Frontend uses `@microsoft/signalr` to subscribe and update UI in real time.

---

## Database & Persistence (EF Core)

- All readings are stored in SQLite by default (can be swapped for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Migrations ensure schema is up to date.

---

## API Endpoints & Data Flow

- `GET /api/motor` — fetch latest readings
- `GET /api/motor/sample` — trigger a new reading (from C++ engine)
- `GET /health` — health check
- `GET /swagger/index.html` — OpenAPI docs

Frontend uses axios to call these endpoints and SignalR for real-time updates.

---

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (for frontend dev)
- .NET 8+ SDK (for backend dev)
- C++ compiler (for building EngineMock)

### Local Development

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Or run backend and frontend separately:

**Backend:**

```sh
cd motor-speed-backend/Server/MotorServer
dotnet run
```

**Frontend:**

```sh
cd motor-speed-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Testing

### Backend (xUnit)

- Unit and integration tests are in `motor-speed-backend/Tests/` and `motor-speed-backend/Server/Tests/`.
- To run all backend tests:

  ```sh
  dotnet test motor-speed-backend/Tests/
  dotnet test motor-speed-backend/Server/Tests/
  ```

- Example test (C#):

  ```csharp
  [Fact]
  public async Task Sample_ShouldReturnValidReading() {
      var svc = new EngineService(...);
      var reading = await svc.Sample();
      Assert.InRange(reading.Speed, 800, 3000);
  }
  ```

### Frontend (React Testing Library)

- Tests are in `motor-speed-frontend/src/components/__tests__/`.
- To run all frontend tests:

  ```sh
  cd motor-speed-frontend
  npm test
  ```

- Example test (React):

  ```tsx
  import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
  import AnimatedMotor from "../AnimatedMotor";
  test("renders without crashing", () => {
    render(<AnimatedMotor rpm={1200} />);
  });
  ```

---

## Docker Usage

### Overview

- Both backend and frontend have their own `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- The project uses `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate backend, frontend, and Nginx for HTTPS/routing.

### Building and Running with Docker Compose

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the C++ engine, .NET backend, and React frontend
- Start all services and Nginx for HTTPS
- Serve the dashboard at `https://localhost/` (or as configured)

### Backend Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MotorServer.dll"]
```

### Frontend Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build
EXPOSE 5173
CMD ["npm", "run", "preview"]
```

### Nginx

- Handles HTTPS, static file serving, and reverse proxy to backend/frontend.
- Self-signed certs for dev in `/etc/nginx/certs/` (see nginx.conf)
- For production, replace with real certs

---

## Features & Functionality

- Real-time motor readings (SignalR)
- Animated 3D gear and shadow
- Grouped reading list by date, color-coded
- Notification sidebar for highest/lowest temp and RPM
- Real-time charts (Recharts)
- CSV export
- Health check endpoint
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- Dark mode toggle
- Settings modal (max readings, dark mode)
- Responsive, modern UI

---

## Extending & Reusing Components

- All React components are modular and reusable.
- Backend services and controllers are easily extensible for new endpoints or hardware.
- To use in another project, copy the relevant component/service and update types as needed.

---

## Real-World Practical Notes

- **Hardware Integration:** Replace the mock C++ engine with your real hardware library. Use P/Invoke or C++/CLI as needed.
- **Protocols:** For CAN/USB/EtherCAT, use a vendor SDK or open-source stack, and expose a C API for .NET interop.
- **Security:** Add authentication/authorization for production.
- **Scalability:** Swap SQLite for a production DB, use Redis for SignalR backplane if scaling out.
